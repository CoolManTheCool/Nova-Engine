## Quick Installation
For a one-liner to install all dependencies, copy and paste the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libglm-dev libopenal-dev vulkan-tools libvulkan-dev vulkan-validationlayers-dev glslc spirv-tools
```
## Setting Up Development Environment for Vulkan

### Install GLFW (Graphics Library Framework)
```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
```
GLFW is a library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and receiving input and events.

### Install GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)
```bash
sudo apt install libglm-dev
```
GLM is a mathematics library for graphics programming, providing functions and classes to manipulate vectors, matrices, and geometric primitives.

### Install OpenAL (Open Audio Library)
```bash
sudo apt install libopenal-dev
```
OpenAL is a cross-platform audio API for spatializing sound in 3D environments.

### Install Vulkan Tools
```bash
sudo apt install vulkan-tools
```
Vulkan Tools includes various utilities for Vulkan development, such as validation layers and performance analysis tools.

### Install Vulkan Development Libraries
```bash
sudo apt install libvulkan-dev
```
This package installs development headers and libraries required for Vulkan application development.

### Install Vulkan Validation Layers Development
```bash
sudo apt install vulkan-validationlayers-dev
```
Vulkan Validation Layers are optional components that help developers debug and validate their Vulkan applications.

### Install GLSL Compiler (GLSLang)
```bash
sudo apt install glslc
```
GLSL Compiler compiles GLSL shaders into SPIR-V, the intermediate language used by Vulkan.

### Install SPIR-V Tools
```bash
sudo apt install spirv-tools
```
SPIR-V Tools is a collection of tools for processing SPIR-V shaders, including validation, optimization, and conversion.

### Testing

After installation, you can verify your Vulkan setup using the following commands:

- **vulkaninfo:** Displays information about Vulkan capabilities and available devices.
- **vkcube:** Runs a simple Vulkan demo application to test basic functionality.

For detailed tutorials and guides on setting up Vulkan development environments, you can refer to resources like [Vulkan Tutorial - Development Environment](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment).
